## ‚öôÔ∏è Assumptions & Considerations

1. **Authentication**: The app uses a mock API ([Reqres](https://reqres.in/)) for login and user management. The token is stored in `localStorage` for simplicity.
2. **API Integration**: All user data is fetched from the Reqres API. This includes paginated user lists and individual user details.
3. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is implemented for API calls, but additional improvements may be required for production use.
4. **Styling**: TailwindCSS is used for styling. Ensure you have the necessary PostCSS setup if extending the styles.
5. **Routing**: React Router is used for client-side navigation. Ensure the app is deployed on a platform that supports SPA routing (e.g., Vercel with the provided `vercel.json`).

## üåê Deployment

The app is configured to be deployed on **Vercel**. The `vercel.json` file ensures proper routing for single-page applications. To deploy:

1. Install the Vercel CLI:
   ```sh
   npm install -g vercel
   ```
2. Deploy the app:
   ```sh
   vercel
   ```
